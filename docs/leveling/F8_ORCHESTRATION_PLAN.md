## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **No Compromise on Quality Gates**: Every gate must pass
2. **Parallel Execution**: Agents work simultaneously, not sequentially
3. **Daily Validation**: Progress verified every 24 hours
4. **Immediate Blocker Resolution**: No blocker survives >4 hours
5. **Evidence-Based Progress**: All claims backed by metrics

---

## ðŸ“¡ Command & Control

**Orchestrator**: Architecture Consultant  
**Escalation**: Immediate to human for CRITICAL blockers  
**Communication**: Async via task system, sync for blockers  
**Validation**: Continuous with hourly checkpoints  
**Rollback**: Always ready, tested daily
