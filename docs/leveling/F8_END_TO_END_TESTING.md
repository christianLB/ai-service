## Conclusion

The implementation of F8 End-to-End Testing is **CRITICAL** for the survival and success of this financial platform. With <10% test coverage on a system handling real money, every day without comprehensive testing increases the risk of catastrophic failure.

**The unanimous recommendation from all specialist agents is: BEGIN IMMEDIATELY.**

### Next Steps

1. **Today**: Install Playwright and create first test
2. **This Week**: Establish foundation and CI integration
3. **Month 1**: Achieve 40% coverage milestone
4. **Month 2**: Reach 80% coverage target

**Remember**: This is not optional. This is survival.
