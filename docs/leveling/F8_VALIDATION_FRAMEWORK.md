## 🛡️ Quality Gate Architecture

### The Iron Law of Testing

```yaml
iron_law:
  principle: 'NO CODE ADVANCES WITHOUT PASSING ALL GATES'
  enforcement: 'AUTOMATIC - NO EXCEPTIONS'
  violations: 'IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK + INVESTIGATION'

  gate_hierarchy:
    L0_Syntax: 'Code must compile'
    L1_Lint: 'Code must be clean'
    L2_Unit: 'Components must work'
    L3_Integration: 'Services must communicate'
    L4_E2E: 'System must function'
    L5_Security: 'System must be secure'

## 📊 Validation Metrics Dashboard

### Real-Time Metrics

```typescript
interface ValidationMetrics {
  coverage: {
    unit: number; // Target: 60%
    integration: number; // Target: 20%
    e2e: number; // Target: 15%
    total: number; // Target: 80%
  };

  quality: {
    passRate: number; // Target: >98%
    flakiness: number; // Target: <2%
    duration: number; // Target: <10min
    failures: TestFailure[];
  };

  security: {
    vulnerabilities: {
      critical: number; // Target: 0
      high: number; // Target: 0
      medium: number; // Target: <5
      low: number; // Acceptable
    };
    compliance: {
      gdpr: boolean; // Required: true
      pciDss: boolean; // Required: true
      owasp: boolean; // Required: true
    };
  };

  performance: {
    responseTime: {
      p50: number; // Target: <200ms
      p95: number; // Target: <500ms
      p99: number; // Target: <1000ms
    };
    throughput: number; // Target: >1000 req/s
    errorRate: number; // Target: <0.1%
  };
}
```

### Validation Score Calculation

```typescript
function calculateValidationScore(metrics: ValidationMetrics): number {
  const weights = {
    coverage: 0.3,
    quality: 0.25,
    security: 0.25,
    performance: 0.2,
  };

  const scores = {
    coverage: metrics.coverage.total / 80,
    quality: metrics.quality.passRate / 100,
    security: metrics.security.vulnerabilities.critical === 0 ? 1 : 0,
    performance: metrics.performance.responseTime.p95 < 500 ? 1 : 0,
  };

  return Object.entries(weights).reduce((total, [key, weight]) => {
    return total + scores[key] * weight * 100;
  }, 0);
}
```

## 🔴 Enforcement Protocol

### Violation Response Matrix

```yaml
violations:
  critical:
    description: 'Security vulnerability or data corruption risk'
    response: 'IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK + INCIDENT RESPONSE'
    escalation: 'CTO + Security Team'
    timeline: 'Fix within 2 hours'

  high:
    description: 'Tests failing or coverage dropping'
    response: 'BLOCK ALL MERGES'
    escalation: 'Tech Lead + QA Lead'
    timeline: 'Fix within 4 hours'

  medium:
    description: 'Performance regression or flaky tests'
    response: 'WARNING + INVESTIGATION'
    escalation: 'Team Lead'
    timeline: 'Fix within 24 hours'

  low:
    description: 'Documentation or minor issues'
    response: 'LOGGED FOR NEXT SPRINT'
    escalation: 'Team'
    timeline: 'Fix within 1 week'
```

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

```typescript
class RollbackManager {
  evaluateDeployment(metrics: ValidationMetrics): DeploymentDecision {
    // Critical failures = immediate rollback
    if (metrics.security.vulnerabilities.critical > 0) {
      return this.rollback('CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY');
    }

    if (metrics.coverage.total < 70) {
      // 10% tolerance
      return this.rollback('COVERAGE BELOW THRESHOLD');
    }

    if (metrics.quality.passRate < 95) {
      return this.rollback('TEST FAILURE RATE TOO HIGH');
    }

    if (metrics.performance.errorRate > 1) {
      return this.rollback('ERROR RATE EXCEEDS LIMIT');
    }

    return { decision: 'PROCEED', confidence: this.calculateConfidence(metrics) };
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

1. **NO DEPLOYMENT WITHOUT 80% COVERAGE**
2. **NO MERGE WITHOUT PASSING GATES**
3. **NO OVERRIDE OF SECURITY GATES**
4. **NO MANUAL VALIDATION - AUTOMATE EVERYTHING**
5. **NO EXCUSES - FIX OR ROLLBACK**

---

_This validation framework is MANDATORY. Violations will trigger automatic rollback and investigation. Quality is not optional._
