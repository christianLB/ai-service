# Technical Debt: SQL to Prisma ORM Migration

**Created**: 2025-01-31  
**Status**: 🟡 IN PROGRESS - ~35-40% Complete  
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-31  

## Overview

The AI Service codebase is undergoing a major migration from raw SQL queries to Prisma ORM. This migration was initiated to improve type safety, maintainability, and developer experience. However, the migration has been partially completed, creating a mixed state where some services use Prisma while others still rely on raw SQL queries.

This technical debt poses significant challenges:
- **Inconsistent data access patterns** across the codebase
- **Duplicate implementations** of the same functionality (SQL vs Prisma)
- **Maintenance burden** of supporting two different data access methods
- **Type safety gaps** in SQL-based services
- **Testing complexity** with different patterns

## 🚨 CRITICAL WARNING: ZERO DATA LOSS TOLERANCE

**THIS IS A PRODUCTION FINANCIAL SYSTEM HANDLING REAL MONEY. DATA LOSS IS NOT AN OPTION.**

### Absolute Requirements:
- **ZERO DATA LOSS**: Any data loss during migration means complete failure
- **100% DATA INTEGRITY**: Every transaction, invoice, and financial record must be preserved perfectly
- **AUDIT TRAIL PRESERVATION**: All historical data and relationships must remain intact
- **ROLLBACK CAPABILITY**: Must be able to restore to exact pre-migration state within 5 minutes

### Consequences of Data Loss:
- **Business Failure**: Loss of financial data = loss of business credibility
- **Legal Liability**: Missing invoices or transactions = legal and tax compliance issues
- **Client Trust**: Lost client data = permanent damage to business relationships
- **Financial Impact**: Unrecoverable revenue data = direct monetary losses

### Mandatory Safeguards:
1. **Triple Backup Strategy**: Database, file system, and cloud backups before ANY change
2. **Data Validation**: Row-by-row comparison between SQL and Prisma results
3. **Checksums**: Calculate checksums for critical financial tables before/after migration
4. **Parallel Running**: Both systems must run in parallel with data comparison for minimum 7 days
5. **Instant Rollback**: One-command rollback to previous state with data integrity verification

## ❌ Services Still Using Raw SQL

### High Priority - Core Financial Services
These services handle critical financial data and should be migrated first:

1. **`financial/database.service.ts`** ⚠️
   - Central database connection pool
   - Used by multiple route handlers
   - Example: `/src/routes/financial/dashboard.routes.ts` uses this extensively

2. **`financial/client-management.service.ts`** ⚠️
   - 458 lines of complex SQL operations
   - Duplicate of `client-prisma.service.ts`
   - Should be deprecated in favor of Prisma version

3. **`financial/gocardless.service.ts`** ⚠️
   - Bank integration with complex queries
   - Critical for transaction imports
   - Uses raw SQL for transaction matching

4. **`financial/reporting.service.ts`** ⚠️
   - Financial reporting with 20+ complex SQL queries
   - Year-end reports, P&L statements
   - Heavy use of CTEs and window functions

5. **`financial/transaction-matching.service.ts`**

   - Sequential numbering with locks
   - Critical for invoice generation

8. **`financial/ai-categorization.service.ts`**
   - Legacy version still in use
   - Should switch to Prisma version

### Medium Priority - Trading & Market Data
9. **`trading/trading-brain.service.ts`**
   - AI trading decision engine
   - Complex calculations and joins

## 🔄 Dual Implementation Anti-Pattern

Several services have BOTH SQL and Prisma versions running simultaneously:

| Service | SQL Version | Prisma Version | Status |
|---------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Client Management | `client-management.service.ts` | `client-prisma.service.ts` | ⚠️ Both Active |
| AI Categorization | `ai-categorization.service.ts` | `ai-categorization-prisma.service.ts` | ⚠️ Both Active |
| Invoice Management | `invoice-management.service.ts` | `invoice-prisma.service.ts` | ⚠️ Both Active |

**Impact**: Controllers sometimes use SQL version, sometimes Prisma, creating inconsistency.

## 📊 Technical Challenges

### 1. Complex SQL Queries
Many services use advanced SQL features that need careful Prisma translation:
```sql
-- Example from reporting.service.ts
WITH monthly_summary AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', date) as month,
    SUM(CASE WHEN amount > 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as income,
    SUM(CASE WHEN amount < 0 THEN ABS(amount) ELSE 0 END) as expenses
  FROM financial.transactions
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) = $1
  GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', date)
)
SELECT * FROM monthly_summary ORDER BY month;
```

### 2. Dynamic Query Building
Services build queries dynamically based on filters:
```typescript
// From client-management.service.ts
let query = 'SELECT * FROM financial.clients WHERE 1=1';
if (filters.status) query += ` AND status = '${filters.status}'`;
if (filters.search) query += ` AND name ILIKE '%${filters.search}%'`;
// SQL injection risk + hard to replicate in Prisma
```

### 3. Transaction Management
Heavy use of database transactions:
```typescript
// From invoice-numbering.service.ts
await pool.query('BEGIN');
await pool.query('LOCK TABLE invoice_sequences IN EXCLUSIVE MODE');
const result = await pool.query('UPDATE invoice_sequences SET ...');
await pool.query('COMMIT');
```

### 4. Performance Optimizations
Custom indexes and query optimizations that need preservation:
```sql
-- From market-data.service.ts
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_market_data_composite 
ON trading.market_data(symbol, timeframe, timestamp DESC);
```

### 5. Missing Schema Elements
Some tables referenced in SQL don't exist in Prisma schema:
- `sync_logs` - Used for GoCardless sync tracking
- `integration_logs` - API integration logging
- `workflow_executions` - Workflow engine data

## 🛡️ Data Integrity Verification Procedures

### Pre-Migration Data Integrity Checks
```bash
# 1. Calculate checksums for all financial tables
make db-checksum > pre-migration-checksums.txt

# 2. Export critical data counts
SELECT 'clients' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM financial.clients
UNION ALL
SELECT 'invoices', COUNT(*) FROM financial.invoices
UNION ALL  
SELECT 'transactions', COUNT(*) FROM financial.transactions
UNION ALL
SELECT 'categories', COUNT(*) FROM financial.categories;

# 3. Calculate financial totals
SELECT 
  SUM(total) as total_invoice_amount,
  COUNT(DISTINCT client_id) as unique_clients,
  COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_number) as unique_invoices
FROM financial.invoices;

# 4. Verify sequence integrity
SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING(invoice_number FROM '\d+') AS INTEGER)) as max_invoice_number
FROM financial.invoices;
```

### During Migration Verification
```typescript
// Every Prisma query MUST be validated against SQL
const validateMigration = async (operation: string) => {
  const sqlResult = await sqlService.execute(operation);
  const prismaResult = await prismaService.execute(operation);
  
  // Deep comparison including:
  // - Record counts
  // - Sum totals
  // - Individual record comparison
  // - Data type consistency
  
  if (!deepEqual(sqlResult, prismaResult)) {
    throw new Error(`DATA INTEGRITY FAILURE: ${operation}`);
  }
};
```

### Post-Migration Verification
1. **Row-by-row comparison** of all financial records
2. **Checksum validation** against pre-migration values
3. **Financial reconciliation** - all totals must match exactly
4. **Sequence verification** - no gaps in invoice numbers
5. **Relationship integrity** - all foreign keys valid

## 📈 Migration Checklist

### For Each Service Migration:
- [ ] Add missing models to Prisma schema
- [ ] Implement Prisma queries matching SQL functionality
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Update TypeScript types to use Prisma generated types
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Performance test against SQL version
- [ ] Update dependent services/routes
- [ ] Document any Prisma raw queries used
- [ ] Remove SQL version after verification
- [ ] Update API documentation

## 🚧 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Stop Creating New SQL Services
- **MANDATORY**: All new services must use Prisma
- Use existing Prisma services as templates
- No new `pool.query()` calls allowed

### 2. Fix Schema Gaps
Add missing tables to Prisma schema:
```prisma
model SyncLog {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  service      String
  status       String
  started_at   DateTime
  completed_at DateTime?
  error        String?
  metadata     Json?
  
  @@schema("financial")
}

model IntegrationConfig {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  service    String   @unique
  config     Json
  is_active  Boolean  @default(true)
  created_at DateTime @default(now())
  updated_at DateTime @updatedAt
  
  @@schema("public")
}
```

### 3. Establish Migration Pattern
Create a standard migration approach:
1. Create Prisma version alongside SQL version
2. Add feature flag to switch between them
3. Gradually migrate routes to use Prisma version
4. Monitor for issues
5. Remove SQL version after stabilization

### 4. Update Documentation
- Document Prisma patterns for complex queries
