# Auth Module Migration Status

## Summary
The auth module migration to Prisma has been completed. Only one auth service was found and migrated.

## Completed Services (1/1) ✅

### Auth Service
1. **auth.service.ts** → **auth-prisma.service.ts** ✅
   - User authentication (login/logout)
   - JWT token management
   - Refresh token handling
   - User CRUD operations
   - Feature flag: `USE_PRISMA_AUTH`

## New Features in Prisma Version

The Prisma-based auth service includes additional functionality:

1. **updatePassword()** - Allow users to change their password
2. **resetPassword()** - Admin function to reset user passwords
3. **setUserActive()** - Activate/deactivate user accounts
4. **listUsers()** - Admin function to list all users with pagination
5. **cleanupExpiredTokens()** - Clean up expired refresh tokens

## Feature Flag Configuration

Add to `.env.local`:
```
# Auth Module Feature Flag
USE_PRISMA_AUTH=true
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# Test refresh token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/refresh \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"refreshToken":"your-refresh-token"}'

# Test get current user
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"
```

## Migration Notes

1. The auth service was the only auth-related service found in the codebase
2. The migration preserves all existing functionality
3. New methods were added to enhance the auth capabilities
4. The service uses the existing User and RefreshToken models from the Prisma schema

## Next Steps

1. Update auth routes to utilize the new methods
2. Test the auth flow with Prisma enabled
3. Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints
4. Add two-factor authentication support (future enhancement)
