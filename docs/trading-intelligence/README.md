# Trading Intelligence Module

## Overview

The Trading Intelligence module is a sophisticated AI-powered cryptocurrency trading system that combines technical analysis, market data, and artificial intelligence to make informed trading decisions. Built with TypeScript and integrated with multiple exchanges, it provides automated trading capabilities with comprehensive risk management.

## Architecture

The module follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
