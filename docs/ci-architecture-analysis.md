# GitHub Actions CI/CD Architecture Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: CRITICAL FAILURE üî¥

All GitHub Actions workflows on the `feat/architectural-leveling-epic` branch are failing due to multiple architectural issues:

1. **Package Manager Confusion**: Both `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` exist, causing cache and dependency conflicts
2. **Incorrect Caching Strategy**: E2E workflow attempts to cache with 'pnpm' before installing it
3. **Monorepo Structure Issues**: Inconsistent workspace configuration across workflows
4. **Docker Compose Path Problems**: CI Build workflow references non-existent compose paths
5. **Duplicated Workflow Logic**: Multiple workflows implementing similar patterns with different approaches

**Impact**: Complete CI/CD pipeline failure, blocking all deployments and quality checks.

**Estimated Fix Time**: 4-6 hours for immediate fixes, 2-3 days for architectural improvements.

## Detailed Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Package Manager Chaos (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Project has conflicting package manager artifacts

- `package-lock.json` (npm) - 716KB, last modified Aug 18
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm) - 451KB, last modified Aug 18
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` exists, indicating pnpm monorepo setup
- Frontend has `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true`

**Root Cause**: Migration from npm to pnpm was incomplete

- Workflows use pnpm 10.12.1
- But `package-lock.json` wasn't removed
- This causes unpredictable dependency resolution

**Impact**:

- Cache misses and incorrect dependency installation
- Potential version mismatches between local and CI
- Build failures due to inconsistent node_modules

### 2. E2E Workflow Critical Error (HIGH)

**File**: `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`

**Issue at Line 54**:

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
    cache: 'pnpm' # ‚ùå FAILS - pnpm not installed yet!
```

**Root Cause**: Order of operations error

- Tries to cache pnpm dependencies before enabling corepack
- Node.js setup action can't find pnpm executable

**Fix Required**: Enable corepack BEFORE Node.js setup with cache

### 3. Docker Compose Path Inconsistency (HIGH)

**CI Build Workflow** references:

- `infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml` (lines 111-389)

**Actual structure**:

- ‚úÖ `/infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml` exists
- ‚ùå But main `docker-compose.yml` is at root level
- Inconsistent references across workflows

### 4. Monorepo Architecture Confusion (MEDIUM)

**Current Structure**:

```
/apps/           # Microservices (7 services)
  - api-gateway/
  - financial-svc/
  - trading-svc/
  - ai-core/
  - comm-svc/
  - worker-financial/
  - worker-trading/

/packages/       # Shared packages (7 packages)
  - config/
  - contracts/
  - http-utils/
  - observability/
  - queue-system/
  - sdk-client/
  - trading/

/src/services/   # Legacy monolith services (30+)
/frontend/       # React frontend
```

**Issues**:

- Hybrid architecture: microservices + monolith
- Unclear service boundaries
- Duplicated functionality between `/apps/` and `/src/services/`

### 5. Workflow Duplication (MEDIUM)

**Multiple CI workflows with overlapping responsibilities**:

- `ci.yml` - Main pipeline (781 lines)
- `ci-complete.yml` - Complete pipeline (472 lines)
- `ci-build.yml` - Build & smoke tests (390 lines)
- `e2e-tests.yml` - E2E tests (221 lines)

**Problems**:

- No clear separation of concerns
- Different approaches to same problems
- Maintenance nightmare

## Architectural Issues by Workflow

### CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

‚úÖ **Working correctly**:

- Proper pnpm setup sequence
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Good caching strategy

‚ùå **Issues**:

- Very long (781 lines)
- Smoke tests use root docker-compose.yml
- Mixed responsibility (unit + integration + e2e)

### E2E Tests (`e2e-tests.yml`)

‚ùå **Critical Issues**:

- Line 54: Cache pnpm before installation
- Missing workspace dependencies installation
- No parallel test execution

### CI Complete (`ci-complete.yml`)

‚úÖ **Good patterns**:

- Service matrix for parallel builds
- Proper job dependencies
- Quality gate at the end

‚ùå **Issues**:

- References non-existent services in matrix
- No actual app builds (empty dist folders)
- TypeScript errors allowed to pass (`|| true`)

### CI Build (`ci-build.yml`)

‚ùå **Critical Issues**:

- Wrong docker-compose path
- No pnpm workspace support
- Smoke tests fail due to service unavailability

## Recommended Architecture

### 1. Immediate Stabilization Plan

```yaml
# Fixed E2E workflow pattern
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  # 1. FIRST: Enable pnpm
  - name: Enable Corepack
    run: |
      corepack enable
      corepack prepare pnpm@10.12.1 --activate

  # 2. THEN: Setup Node with cache
  - name: Setup Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '20'
      cache: 'pnpm' # Now this works!

  # 3. Install dependencies
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

### 2. Target Workflow Architecture

```
.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _reusable-setup.yml      # Shared setup logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _reusable-test.yml       # Shared test logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ci.yml                    # Main CI (uses reusables)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-dev.yml            # Dev deployment
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-prod.yml           # Production deployment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup-pnpm/               # Custom action for pnpm
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run-tests/                # Custom test runner
```

### 3. Monorepo CI Strategy

```yaml
# Optimal job structure
jobs:
  detect-changes:
    # Use path filters to detect what changed

  build-packages:
    # Build shared packages first
    strategy:
      matrix:
        package: [config, contracts, http-utils]

  build-services:
    needs: build-packages
    # Build services in parallel
    strategy:
      matrix:
        service: [api-gateway, financial-svc, trading-svc]

  test:
    needs: build-services
    # Run tests in parallel by type
    strategy:
      matrix:
        type: [unit, integration, e2e]
```

## Critical Commands for Validation

```bash
# Verify package manager setup
ls -la | grep -E "package-lock|pnpm-lock"
pnpm --version

# Test workflow locally
act -j e2e-tests --env-file .env.test

# Validate monorepo structure
pnpm -r list

# Check for TypeScript errors
pnpm -r run typecheck

# Test docker compose
docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml config
```

---

## Conclusion

The CI/CD pipeline is in a **critical state** due to package manager confusion and workflow architecture issues. The good news is that most issues are **quickly fixable** with the right approach.

**Immediate action required**:

1. Fix E2E workflow pnpm cache issue
2. Remove package-lock.json
3. Standardize pnpm setup across all workflows

**Estimated timeline**:

- P0 fixes: 2-3 hours
- Full stabilization: 2-3 days
- Architectural improvements: 1 week

The hybrid monolith/microservices architecture adds complexity but is manageable with proper CI/CD patterns. Focus on **fixing the basics first**, then improve incrementally.
