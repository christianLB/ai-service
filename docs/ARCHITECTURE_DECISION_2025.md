# Architecture Decision Record - January 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Decision: Monolith vs Microservices

After the Operation Lightning experience and thorough analysis of our architectural drift, we must make a decisive choice about our architecture.

## Current State Assessment

### What We Have Now
- **Hybrid Mess**: Half-extracted microservices with shared database
- **Duplicate Code**: Services in both `/src/services` and `/apps/*`
- **Distributed Monolith**: All the complexity of microservices, none of the benefits
- **Failed Tests**: E2E tests failing due to architectural confusion
- **Schema Separation**: Database schemas separated but still in single instance

### The Brutal Truth
We attempted to have both monolith safety AND microservices benefits. 
**Result**: We got neither. We have monolith coupling with distributed complexity.

## ðŸš¨ The Decision: Enhanced Monolith (For Now)

After careful consideration of our constraints and reality:

### **We choose: Enhanced Modular Monolith**

## Why This Decision

### 1. Time to Market
- **Monolith**: 1 week to production stability
- **True Microservices**: 4-6 weeks minimum
- **Business Reality**: We need to ship now, not in 6 weeks

### 2. Team Size & Expertise
- **Current Team**: Small, not experienced with distributed systems
- **Microservices Requirement**: Dedicated teams per service
- **Reality**: We don't have the team structure for true microservices

### 3. Operational Complexity
- **Current Ops**: Single deployment, single database
- **Microservices Ops**: Service mesh, distributed tracing, event bus
- **Reality**: We're not ready for this complexity

### 4. The Failed Experiment
- **60+ agents couldn't make it work**: If massive parallelization failed, forcing it won't help
- **Architectural debt created**: More complexity without benefits
- **Lesson learned**: Architecture can't be rushed

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Consolidation (This Week)
1. **Move all services back to `/src/services`**
2. **Remove `/apps/*` directory structure**
3. **Single deployment unit**
4. **Keep schema separation for future**
5. **Fix all tests**

### Phase 2: Modular Boundaries (Next Week)
1. **Create clear module boundaries**
2. **Enforce dependency rules**
3. **No cross-module database access**
4. **Module-level API contracts**

### Phase 3: Future Extraction (When Ready)
1. **Extract one module at a time**
2. **Prove it works independently**
3. **Only then extract the next**
4. **Timeline: 2025 Q2 earliest**

## Technical Decisions

### Database Strategy
```yaml
Decision: Single PostgreSQL instance
Schemas: Keep separated (financial, trading, ai, comm)
Reason: Easier future extraction
Implementation: Prisma with schema parameter
```

### API Strategy
```yaml
Decision: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI contracts
Gateway: Remove for now (unnecessary complexity)
Direct Access: Frontend â†’ Backend API directly
Future: Can add gateway when extracting services
```

### Deployment Strategy
```yaml
Decision: Single Docker container
Compose: Simplified docker-compose.yml
Environment: Dev, Staging, Production
CI/CD: Single pipeline, faster deployments
```

### Testing Strategy
```yaml
Decision: Focus on monolithic testing
Unit Tests: Per module
Integration Tests: Cross-module
E2E Tests: Full application flows
Performance: Single service benchmarks
```

## What We Keep from Microservices Attempt

### Good Decisions to Preserve
1. **OpenAPI Specifications**: Keep for API documentation
2. **Schema Separation**: Maintain for future extraction
3. **Module Boundaries**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Domain Models**: Well-defined business domains

### What We Remove
1. **API Gateway**: Unnecessary complexity
2. **Service Separation**: Merge back to monolith
3. **Multiple Deployments**: Single deployment
4. **Inter-service Communication**: Direct function calls

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (1 Week)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Single deployment working
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline green
- [ ] No duplicate code

### Short Term (1 Month)
- [ ] 99.9% uptime
- [ ] <200ms API response time
- [ ] Zero critical bugs
- [ ] Clear module boundaries

### Long Term (6 Months)
- [ ] Ready for first service extraction
- [ ] Team trained on distributed systems
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Event bus prototype tested

## Migration Path

### From Current State to Monolith
```bash
1. Stop microservices
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml down

2. Consolidate code
   mv apps/*/src/* src/services/
   rm -rf apps/

3. Update imports
   # Fix all import paths

4. Single deployment
   docker-compose up -d

5. Fix tests
   npm test
   npm run test:e2e
```

### Future: From Monolith to Microservices (2025 Q2+)
```bash
1. Choose one module (probably financial)
2. Extract to separate repository
3. Implement event bus
4. Prove independent deployment
5. Monitor for 1 month
6. Only then extract next module
```

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: "We'll never extract services"
**Mitigation**: Quarterly review with extraction criteria

### Risk: "Monolith will become unmaintainable"
**Mitigation**: Strict module boundaries, enforced by CI

### Risk: "Performance will degrade"
**Mitigation**: Performance tests in CI, module-level optimization

### Risk: "Team morale from 'going backwards'"
**Mitigation**: Frame as "lessons learned" and "pragmatic choice"

## The Hard Truth

We tried to run before we could walk. The 60+ agent orchestration proved that throwing resources at architecture doesn't work. Architecture requires:
- **Thoughtful design** over rapid execution
- **Sequential decisions** over parallel implementation
- **Proven patterns** over ambitious experiments
- **Team readiness** over technical possibility

## Final Decision

**We commit to a Modular Monolith architecture**, with clear boundaries that allow future extraction when we're ready - technically, operationally, and organizationally.

This is not failure. This is wisdom.

## Sign-off

- **Date**: January 19, 2025
- **Decision**: Modular Monolith
- **Timeline**: Immediate consolidation
- **Review Date**: April 2025 (Q2)
- **Extraction Consideration**: Not before Q2 2025
