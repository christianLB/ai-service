# Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Date**: July 25, 2025  
**Status**: Completed

## Overview

All documentation has been reorganized from scattered locations into a structured `/docs/` directory organized by domain. This improves discoverability, reduces duplication, and follows industry best practices.

## Structure Created

```
/docs/
├── README.md                      # Main documentation hub
├── api-reference/                 # API documentation (existing)
├── archive/                       # Historical/outdated docs
│   └── legacy/                    # Old proposals and plans
├── authentication/                # Security and auth docs
├── communication/                 # Telegram, MCP Bridge
├── deployment/                    # CI/CD, infrastructure
├── development/                   # Dev workflows, automation
├── document-intelligence/         # PDF/DOCX processing (existing)
├── financial-intelligence/        # Banking, invoices
├── frontend/                      # React UI documentation
└── trading-intelligence/          # Crypto trading (existing)
```

## Major Changes

### Files Moved (Total: 80+)

1. **Financial Intelligence** (21 files)
   - GoCardless documentation consolidated
   - Invoice generation docs organized
   - Real estate module docs grouped

2. **Authentication** (5 files)
   - JWT implementation extracted
   - Security best practices centralized
   - Testing guides organized

3. **Deployment** (24 files)
   - CI/CD workflows documented
   - Synology NAS guides consolidated
   - Infrastructure docs organized

4. **Development** (16 files)
   - CRUD automation docs enhanced
   - Makefile documentation grouped
   - Architecture plans organized

5. **Communication** (11 files)
   - Telegram bot docs consolidated
   - MCP Bridge proposals organized

6. **Frontend** (5 files)
   - React implementation guides
   - Dashboard documentation

### Files Archived
- Old battle reports
- Outdated proposals
- Historical migration plans

### Files Deleted
- `.bak` and `.backup` files
- Compiled `.old.js` files
- Redundant duplicates

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Clear domain-based structure
2. **Improved Discovery**: Logical grouping of related docs
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Consolidated scattered docs
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Clear ownership by domain
5. **Better Navigation**: README indexes in each domain

## Migration Notes

- All moves used `git mv` to preserve history
- Symlinks created where needed for build compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing references
- Archive maintained for historical reference

## Next Steps

1. Update any hardcoded documentation links in code
2. Review archived docs for potential deletion
3. Add missing documentation identified during reorganization
4. Create automated documentation generation for APIs

## File Location Reference

For files that were moved, here's a quick reference:

| Old Location | New Location |
|--------------|--------------|
| `/DEPLOYMENT.md` | `/docs/deployment/README.md` |
| `/AUTOMATED-DEVELOPMENT-STACK.md` | `/docs/development/automation/development-stack.md` |
| `/GOCARDLESS_*.md` | `/docs/financial-intelligence/gocardless/` |
| `/AUTH_*.md` | `/docs/authentication/` |
| `/knowledge/` docs | Distributed to relevant domain folders |

## Validation

- [x] All domains have README.md indexes
- [x] No broken internal links
- [x] Git history preserved
- [x] Build system compatibility maintained
- [x] Archive structure created
- [x] Legacy files properly archived

This reorganization makes the documentation more maintainable and discoverable for all team members.
