# Offline Information Archives: A Guide

This guide provides a curated list of projects and tools for downloading vital information for offline use. This ensures access to knowledge, navigation, and documentation during a prolonged internet outage.

## 1. General Knowledge: Kiwix

For a broad archive of human knowledge, the clear winner is **Kiwix**. It allows you to have a local copy of sites like Wikipedia.

- **What it is:** Kiwix is a free, open-source program that lets you download and read educational content offline.
- **How it works:** It uses highly compressed `ZIM` files. You use the Kiwix reader to browse the content.
- **Key Links:**
  - **Main Project:** [https://www.kiwix.org/en/](https://www.kiwix.org/en/)
  - **Content Library (ZIM files):** [https://library.kiwix.org/](https://library.kiwix.org/)
- **Available Content:**
  - Wikipedia
  - Project Gutenberg (eBooks)
  - TED Talks
  - Stack Exchange sites
  - Medical Textbooks

## 2. Full Website Mirroring: HTTrack & wget

To save a specific website that isn't in the Kiwix library, you can mirror it yourself.

### HTTrack

A purpose-built "website copier" that is user-friendly and great for creating browseable offline copies of entire sites.

## 3. Developer Documentation: Zeal

For any developer, having offline documentation is critical. **Zeal** is the perfect tool for this.
