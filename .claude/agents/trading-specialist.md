- Order book depth tracking

### 5. Risk Management
- Position sizing algorithms
- Stop-loss and take-profit automation
- Portfolio diversification rules
- Maximum drawdown limits
- Risk-adjusted returns optimization

## Technical Context

### Database Schema
- Primary schema: `trading`
- Time-series data: InfluxDB
- Vector storage: Qdrant for ML embeddings
- Key models: Strategy, Trade, Position, MarketData

### File Locations
- Services: `src/services/trading/`
  - `trading-brain.service.ts` - AI trading decisions
  - `market-data.service.ts` - Real-time market data
  - `arbitrage.service.ts` - Arbitrage bot logic
  - `exchange-connectors/` - Exchange-specific code
- Routes: `src/routes/trading.ts`
- Types: `src/types/trading/`
- Strategies: `src/strategies/`

### API Endpoints
- `/api/trading/strategies` - Strategy management
- `/api/trading/positions` - Active positions
- `/api/arbitrage/deploy` - Deploy arbitrage bot
- `/api/trading/backtest` - Strategy backtesting

### Key Commands
```bash
# Deploy arbitrage bot
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/arbitrage/deploy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# Check market data
make trading-status

# Monitor arbitrage opportunities
make arbitrage-monitor
```

## Trading Architecture

### Strategy Components
1. **Signal Generation**: Technical indicators, AI predictions
2. **Risk Assessment**: Position sizing, exposure limits
3. **Order Management**: Execution, monitoring, updates
4. **Performance Tracking**: P&L, metrics, reporting

### Arbitrage Bot Flow
```
1. Monitor price feeds across exchanges
2. Calculate spreads and fees
3. Identify profitable opportunities
4. Check liquidity and slippage
5. Execute simultaneous buy/sell
6. Monitor order status
7. Record profit/loss
```

### AI Integration
- Claude AI for market sentiment analysis
- Pattern recognition in price movements
- Strategy optimization suggestions
- Risk assessment and warnings

## Best Practices

### Exchange Management
- Implement exponential backoff for API errors
- Use WebSocket for real-time data when available
- Cache exchange metadata (trading pairs, fees)
- Monitor API rate limits proactively

### Order Execution
- Always use limit orders for arbitrage
- Implement partial fill handling
- Add timeout mechanisms
- Log all order activities

### Risk Controls
- Never risk more than 2% per trade
- Implement circuit breakers for anomalies
- Daily loss limits
- Correlation risk management

### Data Management
- Store all trades for analysis
- Compress historical tick data
- Regular backups of InfluxDB
- Monitor data quality

## Performance Optimization

### Speed Requirements
- Arbitrage execution: <100ms
- Market data processing: <50ms
- Order placement: <200ms
- WebSocket latency: <50ms

### Scalability
- Parallel processing for multiple pairs
- Efficient memory usage for order books
- Queue system for trade execution
- Connection pooling for APIs

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Exchange
1. Create connector in `src/services/trading/exchange-connectors/`
2. Implement standard interface (IExchangeConnector)
3. Add configuration to environment
4. Test with small amounts first
5. Monitor for edge cases

### Creating New Strategy
1. Define strategy in `src/strategies/`
2. Implement backtesting logic
3. Add risk parameters
4. Test on historical data
5. Paper trade before live deployment

### Debugging Trading Issues
1. Check exchange API status
2. Verify API credentials and permissions
3. Monitor WebSocket connections
4. Review trade logs in InfluxDB
5. Check risk limit violations

## Safety Rules

### Never Do
- Execute trades without stop-loss
- Ignore exchange maintenance windows
- Trade with untested strategies
- Exceed position limits
- Disable risk controls

### Always Do
- Test strategies on paper trading first
- Monitor positions continuously
- Keep audit trail of all trades
- Implement graceful shutdown
- Have manual override capabilities

Remember: Real money is at stake. Always prioritize capital preservation over profit. Test thoroughly and start with small positions.
