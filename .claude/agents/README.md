# Claude Code Sub-Agents for AI Service

This directory contains specialized sub-agents for the AI Service project. Each agent is optimized for specific domains and can work independently or in parallel to accelerate development.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Using a Single Agent
```bash
# Example: Use the financial specialist for invoice work
"Use the financial specialist to help me add a new invoice template"

# Example: Use the trading specialist for strategy development
"Use the trading specialist to implement a new arbitrage strategy"
```

### Parallel Agent Execution
```bash
# Example: Multiple agents working on a feature
"Deploy 3 parallel agents:
- financial-specialist: Create invoice calculation service
- ui-specialist: Build invoice preview component  
- qa-specialist: Write tests for invoice module"
```

### Complex Workflows
```bash
# Example: Full-stack feature implementation
"Use sub-agents to implement recurring invoices:
- prisma-specialist: Design database schema
- financial-specialist: Implement business logic
- ui-specialist: Create management interface
- security-specialist: Audit the implementation"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Agent Focus
Best for specialized tasks within one domain:
```
"financial-specialist: implement invoice reminder system"
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Development
Best for features spanning multiple domains:
```
"Deploy parallel agents for user dashboard:
- ui-specialist: Create dashboard layout
- financial-specialist: Calculate metrics
- trading-specialist: Add portfolio widget"
```

### Pattern 3: Sequential Workflow
Best for dependent tasks:
```
"Sequential workflow for new model:
1. prisma-specialist: Design schema
2. crud-specialist: Generate CRUD
3. qa-specialist: Write tests"
```

### Pattern 4: Full-Stack Feature
Best for complete feature implementation:
```
"Implement trading alerts feature using agents:
- prisma-specialist: Alert model schema
- trading-specialist: Alert logic
- ui-specialist: Alert UI
- devops-specialist: WebSocket setup
- security-specialist: Permission system"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Agent
- Match agent expertise to task requirements
- Use domain specialists for complex logic
- Use efficiency agents for repetitive tasks

### 2. Parallel vs Sequential
- Use parallel for independent tasks
- Use sequential for dependent operations
- Maximum 10 parallel agents

### 3. Agent Coordination
- Specify clear tasks for each agent
- Define interfaces between agent outputs
- Review combined results

### 4. Context Efficiency
- Each agent has its own context window
- Reduces main context usage
- Enables larger scope operations

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Usage

### Custom Agent Combinations
```bash
# Security-First Development
"Deploy security-specialist and qa-specialist in parallel:
- security: Audit authentication flow
- qa: Write security test cases"

# Performance Optimization
"Use specialized agents for performance:
- trading-specialist: Optimize algorithms
- devops-specialist: Profile containers
- prisma-specialist: Optimize queries"
```

### Agent Chaining
```bash
# Analysis â†’ Implementation â†’ Testing
"Chain agents for feature development:
1. security-specialist: Analyze requirements
2. financial-specialist: Implement logic
3. qa-specialist: Validate implementation"
```

### Domain-Specific Workflows
```bash
# Financial Module Workflow
"Financial feature workflow:
- prisma-specialist: Transaction schema
- financial-specialist: Business rules
- ui-specialist: Transaction UI
- qa-specialist: Integration tests"

# Trading Module Workflow  
"Trading feature workflow:
- trading-specialist: Strategy design
- prisma-specialist: Performance tables
- ui-specialist: Trading dashboard
- security-specialist: API security"
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Benefits

- **5-10x faster** for multi-domain features
- **Parallel execution** reduces wait time
- **Specialized context** improves accuracy
- **Reduced errors** through domain expertise

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Agent Independence**: Each agent works in isolation
2. **No Cross-Communication**: Agents don't share context
3. **Main Coordination**: You coordinate agent outputs
4. **Resource Limits**: Max 10 parallel agents
