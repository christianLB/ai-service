- [ ] Uptime monitoring (Uptime Robot/Pingdom)

## Deployment Steps

### Phase A: Infrastructure (Day 6)
```bash
# 1. Deploy databases
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d postgres-financial postgres-trading

# 2. Run migrations
npm run migrate:prod

# 3. Verify data integrity
npm run verify:database
```

### Phase B: Services (Day 7)
```bash
# 4. Deploy services in order
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d financial-service
# Wait 5 minutes, verify health
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d trading-service
# Wait 5 minutes, verify health
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d api-gateway

# 5. Smoke tests
npm run test:smoke:prod
```

### Phase C: Cutover (Day 8)
```bash
# 6. DNS update (with low TTL)
# Point api.domain.com → API Gateway

# 7. Monitor for 1 hour
# Check logs, metrics, user reports

# 8. Gradual traffic shift
# 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
```

## Rollback Procedure

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Revert DNS to monolith
# Stop new services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Restart monolith
docker-compose -f docker-compose.legacy.yml up -d
```

### Data Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Restore database backup
pg_restore -d ai_service backup_pre_deploy.sql

# Replay missed transactions
npm run replay:transactions --from="2024-01-20"
```

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Hour 1
- [ ] All health checks passing
- [ ] Error rate < 0.1%
- [ ] Response times normal
- [ ] No customer complaints

### Day 1
- [ ] 24-hour metrics review
- [ ] Performance analysis
- [ ] Cost analysis
- [ ] Security scan

### Week 1
- [ ] Retrospective meeting
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Optimization opportunities
- [ ] Phase 5 planning (future services)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Zero downtime during deployment
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Performance equal or better than monolith
- ✅ All critical features working
- ✅ Rollback tested but not needed
