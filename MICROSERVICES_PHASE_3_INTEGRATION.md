# Phase 3: Integration Testing

**Status**: PENDING  
**Timeline**: Day 3-5  
**Priority**: HIGH

## Prerequisites
- ✅ Phase 2 completed (all services stable)
- ✅ Gateway routing verified
- ✅ Auth working across services

## Test Suites Required

### 1. Authentication Flow Testing
- [ ] Login via gateway → JWT generation
- [ ] Token validation across services
- [ ] Refresh token flow
- [ ] Logout and token revocation
- [ ] Brute force protection verification
- [ ] Session management across services

### 2. Financial Service E2E Tests
- [ ] Create client → Create invoice → Process payment
- [ ] GoCardless integration through gateway
- [ ] Transaction categorization workflow
- [ ] Multi-currency operations
- [ ] Bulk operations (import/export)
- [ ] Error handling and rollback scenarios

### 3. Trading Service E2E Tests
- [ ] Strategy creation and execution
- [ ] Position management lifecycle
- [ ] Market data streaming through gateway
- [ ] Backtesting workflows
- [ ] Risk management rules
- [ ] Order execution flow

### 4. Frontend Integration Tests
- [ ] Dashboard loads with all widgets
- [ ] Client management CRUD operations
- [ ] Invoice generation and PDF export
- [ ] Trading interface functionality
- [ ] Real-time updates via websockets
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile

### 5. Performance Testing
- [ ] Load test: 100 concurrent users
- [ ] Stress test: 1000 req/sec to gateway
- [ ] Endurance test: 24 hours continuous operation
- [ ] Database connection pool testing
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] Response time benchmarks (< 200ms p95)

### 6. Failure Scenario Testing
- [ ] Service crashes and auto-recovery
- [ ] Database connection failures
- [ ] Network partitioning
- [ ] Gateway circuit breaker activation
- [ ] Cascading failure prevention
- [ ] Data consistency during failures

## Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Test database with sample data
npm run seed:test

# Start services in test mode
NODE_ENV=test docker-compose up

# Run test suites
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:integration
npm run test:performance
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ 100% test coverage for critical paths
- ✅ Zero data loss during failure scenarios
- ✅ < 200ms response time (p95)
- ✅ < 1% error rate under load
- ✅ Successful 24-hour endurance test

## Test Report Requirements
- Performance benchmarks document
- Security audit results
- Load test graphs
- Error rate analysis
- Recommendations for production

## Next Phase Gate
Move to Phase 4 (Production) only when:
- All test suites passing
- Performance targets met
- No critical/high severity bugs
- Rollback procedures tested
